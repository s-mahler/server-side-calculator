# Project Name

Server Side Calculator

## Description
Duration: Two Day Sprint

This project creates a calculator that takes two numerical inputs and an operator (+, -, *, or /) and displays the result. All logic for the calculation is done server side, using node and express. The results are displayed on the webpage, as well as the history of calculations. One area of improvement for this project is input validation. Currently, a submission lacking an operator is not allowed, with an alert being displayed and the calculation not being included in the history. However, blank inputs for the two numbers are still accepted.
